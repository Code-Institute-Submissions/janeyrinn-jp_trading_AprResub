## Overview
JP Trading is family owned business selling fire fuels, aggregates and garden furniture in the East Cork area
of Ireland over the last 8 years.
Currently they have no online presence and would like to establish themselves online to increase growth/retention
of customers and keep up to date with industry standards. 

This website is created to be a landing space for consumers searching for the above mentioned products in the

It should be an asset to the business to increase growth,
while also being of value to the consumer and improving their consumer experience.

### Design
#### Structure

**Skeleton**

The site will be made up of three pages with one main section
per page, all pages will have a 'sticky' navigation bar at the top and a small copyright footer.

**Information Architecture**

The home page will consist of a large hero image with a text introduction of the 
business. This will describe the business and the services available. Icons traditionally
associated with the services offered will be displayed lower down and will reinforce
this information allowing the information to be easily assimilated by the user. 

The second page will be a gallery of current products in stock with some pricing information.
There will be a feature to quick search through the products. A call to action alert will be created
if an item is found in the search. This call to action will link the user to the contact the business. 

The third page will provide contact information, the premise location and a contact form.

**Interaction Design**

The navigation bar will highlight on hover and active status.

The text introduction on the home page will be animated, similar to a carosel, with short paragraphs 
of information. Icons on the homepage will display discriptive text when clicked.

The user will be able to interact with the data on the second page by searching through the products available
and calculate a quote for some items.

On the third page the user will be able to send an email to the business and view the location of its premise.
A confirmation message will display when the email has been sent successfully or an error if unsuccessfull.

#### Wireframes
A mock up of how the site will be layed out is available here via [Wire Frames](assets/read_me/wire_frames.pdf).

*Please note: To open any links in this document in a new browser tab, please press `CTRL + Click`.*

#### Color Scheme
![Color Swatch](assets/read_me/color_swatch.png)
The above color swatch shows a guide line for the color scheme of the site, 
Colors are brand colours which have been adopted for the following reasons:

Color | Consumer Association
------|---------------------
Black | stability, confidence
Yellow| logical, cheerful
Browns| resilience, dependability, security, and safety.

This colour combination is a classic pairing used in by many well known fire fuel brands and therefore
instils a sense of brand establishment and reliabilty in the subconscious of the consumer by association with
well known brands. 

#### Typography

The Sintony font, created by *Eduardo Rodriguez Tunn* for [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) will be the main font for the company name 
and for headings, alternating between regular and bold. Its slightly square and smooth structure lends well to bolder headings, 
demanding the readers attention.

![Heading Font](assets/read_me/heading_font.png)

Montserrat which is designed by *Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, Juan Pablo del Peral, Jacques Le Bailly* and also 
available on Google Fonts, will be the secondary font used for the main body of text and sub headings. 

![Body Font](assets/read_me/body_font.png)

Sans Serif will be the fallback font if for any reason the main fonts are not being imported 
or displayed correctly. Sintony is a variation of Sans Serif, if the chosen font should
not display the back up font should blend seamlessly. 

Both fonts are easily readable with strong straight lines which should be easily read by the user.

#### Imagery
Branding is an important design and marketing tool for establishing your business in the mind of the user.
A logo was created using [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/). Consistant imagery inline with the businesses
offering was used through out the site to reinforce that brand identity and convey the business offering 
intuitively. Images were sourced from open source sites or were provided by JP.Trading. For a detailed list of 
photographers and sources please see the [credits](#credits) section.
