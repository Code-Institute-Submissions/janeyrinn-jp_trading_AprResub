## Strategic Purpose
This website is created to be a landing space for consumers searching for certain products in the Midleton area.
The site will be a marketing tool to promote products on sale, offer contact information/location and
provide a means of contacting the business.

It should be an asset to the business to increase growth,
while also being of value to the consumer and improving their consumer experience.

Features are to showcase products on sale, provide the location and contact information,
allow enquiries and offer consumers a means of contacting
the business while simultaniously developing sales leads for the business owner.

Content should be clear, informative and adapted for screen readers so it is accessible for all.
The site is to be responsive on multiple devices, features should support intuitive learning while being easy and enjoyable to navigate through. 
Creating a positive user experience for customers that they will return to again and again.

### Design Simulation
A simulation of the website on desktop and mobile devices can be seen below.

## User Experience Design

### User Stories
#### First Time and Returning Visitor Goals

As a user I would like to :
>- easily understands the main purpose and navigation pathways of the site.
>- find information is clearly presented and easily absorbed with minimal effort.
>- find that features load quickly.
>- find that features are adapted to my devices screen size.
>- learn more about the company, its products and its pricing structure.
>- search a list of available products.
>- access contact information and contact the organization.
>- find their location.

### Design
#### Structure

The site will be made up of three pages with one main section
per page, all pages will have a 'sticky' navigation bar and a small copyright footer.

The home page will consist of a large hero image with an animated text introduction of the 
business. This will describe the business and the services available. Icons traditionally
associated with the services offered will be displayed lower down and will reinforce
this information allowing the information to be easily assimilated by the user. Icons when clicked
will display descriptive text.

The second page will be a gallery of current products in stock with some pricing information.
there will be a feature to quick search through the products. A call to action alert will be created
if an item is found in the search. This call to action will link the user to the contact the business 
for a quick quote. 

The third page will provide contact information, the premise location and a contact form.

#### Wireframes
A mock up of how the site will be layed out is available here via ![Wire Frames](assets/read_me/wire_frames.pdf).

#### Color Scheme
![Color Swatch](assets/read_me/color_swatch.png)
The above color swatch shows a guide line for the color scheme of the site, 
Colors are brand colours which have been adopted for the following reasons:

Color | Consumer Association
------|---------------------
Black | stability, confidence
Yellow| logical, cheerful

This colour combination is a classic pairing used in by many well known fire fuel brands and therefore
instils a sense of brand establishment and reliabilty in the subconscious of the consumer by association with
well known brands. 

#### Typography

The Sintony font, created by Eduardo Rodriguez Tunn for Google fonts will be the main font for the company name 
and for headings. Its slightly square and smooth structure lends well to bolder headings, 
demanding the readers attention.

Montserrat which is designed by Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, Juan Pablo del Peral, Jacques Le Bailly and also 
available on google fonts, will be the secondary font used for the main body of text and sub headings. 

Sans Serif will be the fallback font if for any reason the main fonts are not being imported 
or displayed correctly. Sintony is a variation of Sans Serif, if the chosen font should
not display the back up font should blend seamlessly. 

Both fonts are easily readable with strong straight lines which should be easily read by the user.

#### Imagery
Branding is an important design and marketing tool for establishing your business in the mind of the user.
a logo was created using [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/). Consistant imagery inline with the businesses
offering was used through out the site to reinforce that brand identity and convey the business offering 
intuitively. Images were sourced from open source sites or were provided by JP.Trading. For a detailed list of 
photographers and sources please see the [credits](#credits) section.
